<h1> What Is It? </h1>
It's the first voice assistant that uses LLMs as it's underlying technology, LLMs means large language models, like ChatGPT and Gemini. <br> 
our competitors like siri and google assistant use a hardcoded method which makes the voice assistant dumb, but AtharAI is not like them because it's using Machine learning which makes it miles ahead of it's competition.

<h1>How to install</h1>
Uninstall your existing python installation <br>
Run <code>installer.bat</code> and it will install every thing, including python 3.10, and you'll be good to go.<br>

<h2>How to switch models</h2>
AtharAI supports both Gemini 1.0 pro by Google, or GPT-4-Turbo by OpenAI, GPT-4-Turbo is more powerful, but AtharAI uses Gemini-1.0-pro by default, here's how you can switch: <br>
1- open up <code>pre.py</code> there you can find the API keys, and the model used <br>
2- to switch to GPT-4-turbo you have to insert you own OpenAI key<br>
3- after inserting your key you can change the <code>model</code> value from <code>"gemini"</code> to <code>"gpt"</code>, then save the changes and run the app, and you'll be using GPT-4-Turbo.
